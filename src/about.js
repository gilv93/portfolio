			<h3>My Story</h3>
			<p>My name is Gilbert and I'm an ex-chemist who is determined to become a self-taught Front End Developer.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>Although a career in chemistry can be fulfilling, over my four year span in the field I came to realize
			my interest had gradually begun to wane. Programming was something I was introduced to near the end of college in
			2015 and had dabbled with one-and-off over the next few years. After going through tutorial after tutorial I 
			finally told myself to get serious and began working on a series of small projects. As I worked on these I
			realized I understood what it meant to be totally interested and motivated by a subject, something I'd
			never felt about with chemistry. This is when I believe I had slowly, truly, become passionate
			about programming and it was time to really try and start my career in the field.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>After four years of working myself up, in August of 2019 I decided to leave my job as a chemist and focus
			on a career in Front End Development. I'm ecstatic to continually add to this growing list of projects and look
			back on them in the future. I hope I can become another success story that people can look to when they
			think they're stuck in a career they don't truly like and are afraid to move on; I hope I can motivate others
			like others have for me in taking a plunge into something totally new and love every moment of it.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>Thank you, for reading my story. - <span class='name'>G.V.</span></p>
